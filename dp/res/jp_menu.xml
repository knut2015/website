					<description><![CDATA[This recipe comes from Homeroom in Oakland, California, a restaurant that specializes in one thing: mac ‘n’ cheese. 
						Owners Erin Wade and Allison Arevalo serve the dish in a multitude of creative combos, but this is their classic version, made with sharp cheddar. 
						It calls for combining béchamel sauce with grated cheese, then stirring in just-cooked pasta. What’s nice about this recipe is its versatility. 
						It works beautifully as both a creamy stovetop dish with any sort of mix-ins you like, and as a crunchy baked mac ‘n’ cheese sprinkled with panko breadcrumbs.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Football (American) championship season. 
						Sports bars, beer, and spicy things that make you want to drink more beer. 
						Darts, pool, loud conversation, an either ill-spent or well-spent youth, depending on your perspective. 
						Once in my early twenties I happened to be in Buffalo, New York for a wedding of a dear friend. 
						On our site-seeing day the gang of us revelers happened to drive right by the Anchor Bar, home of the “Original Buffalo Chicken Wings”.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hello weekend! Sacramento can’t decide if it wants to be hot or cool right now. 
						But the weather has been cooperating gloriously recently, with lots of sun, perfect for relaxing on the patio with tortilla chips or saltines and some coctel de camarones, 
						or Mexican shrimp cocktail. I love this version of shrimp cocktail, it’s sort of like a virgin bloody mary with cucumber, celery, red onions, avocados and lots of shrimp. 
						Perfect for dipping, or eating with a spoon. Or picking out the shrimp pieces with a fork, then the avocado pieces, and then eating the rest with a spoon as if it were gazpacho. 
						Enjoy!]]></description>
